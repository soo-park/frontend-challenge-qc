# React card list

Usually, the code will have more components to make the entire app modulated.
However, Codepen was requested to be used to submit the code.
Since Codepen allows only 10 files for free account unless you pay annual fee,
the following list of things are adjusted to accommodate:

- Components and helper functions were consolidated to fit into the limitation.
- Redux, Thunk, SCSS could not be used because they need more files
- Since Codepen does not allow any media only one SVG image was used
- The mock api server file generated was substituted with hard-coded data

To run the application
1) download all files into one folder
2) in command line, go into the folder, and run the following command
npm install
3) after the installation (ignore the errors on installations) run the following command
npm start
